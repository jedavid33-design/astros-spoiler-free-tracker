# OpalDay

**Your day, gently organized.**

OpalDay is an iPhone- and iPad-friendly PWA for calendars, habits, home resets,
medications, reminders, progress, and a resolved daily timeline.

## This release

App version: **1.3.3**  
Cloudflare Worker version: **0.12.3**

- Daily habit completion is derived from local-date completion history
- Historical calendar dates evaluate completion for the requested date
- Unchecking a daily habit removes only today's record and preserves prior days
- Weekly and other period-based goals retain their existing period behavior
- Local calendar-date rollover refreshes the app without resetting stored history
- Today event cards show calendar identity once in their metadata, without a
  duplicate right-side calendar-name badge

See `UPLOAD-INSTRUCTIONS.txt` for deployment and verification. The Worker is
included in `cloudflare-worker-v0.12.3/`.

## Data safety

The app continues to use `opalday-data-v1`, the existing sync code, the same
D1 database and binding, and the existing event/item/calendar IDs. No SQL
migration, reset, or database replacement is required.
